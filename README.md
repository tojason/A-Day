My manual webpack setup for React JS

If you prefer a comprehensive starter, recommand use the facebook [create-create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)


## Available Scripts
1. `npm run dev`

   Start webpack server in development mode.

   Should host on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). If port `8080` is occupied, try port `8081`.
2. `npm run build`

   Build the react app for production (compile application into static) under `public` folder.
